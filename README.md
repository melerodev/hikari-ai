To deploy the project, you need to have the latest version of Node.js installed and have `pnpm` installed.

To install `pnpm`, run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

Now, to deploy the project, we first need to install the dependencies, build the project, and start it. Run the following commands in this order:

```bash
pnpm install # Install dependencies
pnpm build   # Build the project
pnpm start   # Start the project
```

After that, open [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) in your browser and you will be able to use the application.
